# Analyzer output definition file used by THaOutput class.
# R. Michaels, Sept 2002
# Comments start with '# ' 
#
# There are at present 3 places where output is defined
# in the C++ analyzer, and this is one of them.
# The other two are THaRun (run-dependent info) and
# THaEvent (event-dependent info), which provide quantities 
# like run number and event number that you always need.
# In this place, the "outdef" file, one can define
# global variables, formulas, and histograms, as well
# as cuts on histograms.  The results of the formulas appear 
# in the tree with the formula-name given.
#
# Syntax of file  -- by example:
#
# variable   L.vdc.u2.nclust
# variable   R.s1.lt
# formula    targetX  1.464*B.bpm4b.x-0.464*B.bpm4a.x
# TH1F  rv1n  'R-arm vdc hits on V1'   R.vdc.v1.nhit 100 0 10
# TH1F  rv1w  'R-arm vdc wiremap on V1'  R.vdc.v1.wire 100 0 500
# TH1F  tgtx  'Target X position'   targetX 100 -2 2 
# TH2F  t12  'Time stamps on roc1 vs roc2'  D.timeroc1  D.timeroc2
#       100 0 1000 100 0 1000
# TH1F  s1trx 'R-arm S1 trx (with cut)' R.s1.trx 100 -1 1 R.s1.trx>0
# (note, the cut R.s1.trx>0 appears optionally at the end).
#
# where the keywords are as follows :
# (the keywords are case-insensitive, the rest of the line is not)
#
#   variable  -- indicates that a global variable is to
#                be added to the tree.  The next string is
#                the name of the variable.  You can see a list
#                of variables by typing gHaVars->Print() at
#                the analyzer's root shell prompt.
#                A variable can also be an array, e.g. R.s1.lt  
#                Then the values in the tree will be R.s1.lt.data[0], 
#                R.s1.lt.data[1], etc, up to the array size which
#                is Ndata.R.s1.lt
#  
#    formula  -- indicates a THaFormula to add to the output.
#                The next word (e.g. targetX in the above example)
#                will be the "name" of the formula result in the tree.
#                The 3rd string is the formula to evaluate.  It
#                must involve valid global variables.  It cannot
#                involve arrays or results of other formulas (yet).
#
#    TH1F or TH2F  -- this defines histograms (1D or 2D).
#               The next word is the name of the TH1F object.
#               The following string (must be in single quotes) is 
#               the title of the histogram.  Finally the variables
#               or formulas names that are put into the histogram 
#               are listed.  The code figures out if it is a variable
#               or formula.  If the variable is an array, all elements
#               will be put in the histogram, event-by-event.
#
#    block  -- To put ALL the variables from a block into tree.
#              Example "block L.*"  --> all left-arm variables.
#                      "block R.*"  --> all right-arm variables.
#                      "block D.*"  --> All THaDecData variables.

Hall A C++ Analyzer Frequently Asked Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: How do I compile and install the analyzer on ifarml1/2/3?

A: Download the source tarball, unpack, set up ROOT and gcc, and compile:

   % lynx -source http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/download/analyzer-1.0.tar.gz > analyzer-1.0.tar.gz
   % tar xzvf analyzer-1.0.tar.gz 
   % cd analyzer-1.0
   % use root/3.03-06-gcc3.0.4
   % use gcc/3.0.4
   % make -j4
   ( ... go drink a coffee ... )
   
   To run the analyzer, you will also need to set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

   % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

   Start the analyzer:

   % ./analyzer

   To "install" the analyzer, just add the build directory to your PATH
   as well as LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Q: Why does it build and start up so slowly?

A: Because disk space on iframl1/2/3 is located on busy file servers.
   Things get a bit faster if you work on the local scratch disk 
   /local/scratch, but not much.  To get the speed you deserve, 
   move to your own standalone desktop machine or the Hall A counting 
   house machines.  You will be surprised.

Q: The source used to compile fine, but then I switched to a different
   version of ROOT/gcc/Linux, moved stuff around, etc., and now I get a
   bizarre error like

     Creating dependencies for src/THaVDCCluster.C
     make: *** No rule to make target `src/THaVDCLookupTTDConv.h', 
         needed by `src/THaVDCHit.d'.  Stop.

A: Dependency files (.d) are out of date. To clean things up, do this:

   % find . -name '*.d' -exec rm {} \;
   % make realclean

   Then rebuild the analyzer.

Q: How do I get the latest CVS version?

A: Do this at your own risk. The CVS version may sometimes not even
   compile, and likely will contain untested and undocumented features.

   setenv CVS_RSH ssh
   cvs -d :ext:cvs.jlab.org:/group/halla/analysis/cvs checkout analyzer

   If you want a specific version or branch, add "-r tag" after "checkout",
   for instance

   cvs -d :ext:cvs.jlab.org:/group/halla/analysis/cvs checkout -r Release-100 analyzer

<h1>Hall A C++ Analyzer Installation Guide</h1>

<hr>
<h3>General</h3>
Currently, the C++ Analyzer is distributed only as source code. You will need to compile it yourself.
Precompiled versions are problematic because of the large number of possible combinations of ROOT versions
and compilers, which are not compatible at the binary level.
<p>
Once the analyzer code has become stable, we will provide a pre-installed set of shared libraries
on the Hall A counting house Linux cluster and possibly on /apps. These libraries would be matched with a certain
version of ROOT also pre-installed on those locations.

<hr>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linux or Solaris. Other Unices (e.g. IRIX, AIX, Alpha/OSF/Tru64) will probably work too.
  <li>ROOT 3.02 or higher.
  <li>Decent hardware (recommended 500MHz Pentium 3, 256MB RAM).
  <li>50 MB disk space to build the Analyzer. GBs of disk space for raw data files.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
The following software must be installed and set up prior to unpacking and compiling the analyzer:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a> 3.02 or higher (3.04/02 recommended).
  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc/g++</a> C/C++ compiler 2.95/2.96, 3.0 or higher.
      <b>Important: this MUST be the EXACT SAME compiler version used to compile ROOT!</b>
      Different recent versions of g++ produce incompatible C++ object code.
  <li>On Solaris, the Sun Workshop Compiler 6 (C++ 5.3) or similar.
  <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> make 3.76 or later.
  <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> gzip/gunzip.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Getting the analyzer source code</h3>
Source distributions can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/download/">here</a>.
Unpack the archive as follows:
<pre>
  % tar xzf analyzer-1.0.tar.gz
OR
  % gunzip -c analyzer-1.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
</pre>
The sources will be unpacked into the subdirectory "analyzer-1.0". Go there
<pre>
  % cd analyzer-1.0
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Compilation</h3>
First, ensure that ROOT is properly set up. Inspect the value of the environment variable ROOTSYS.
It must point to the version of ROOT you intend to use. See if you can start ROOT by typing
<pre>
  % root
</pre>
$ROOTSYS/bin must be in your PATH.
<p>
Currently, there is no "configure" script that automatically detects and configures system-dependent
parameters such as compiler, path to applications, etc.
Thus, changing the platform must be done by hand. Fortunately this is rather easy. The default
configuration is for Linux.  So, on Linux you can simply type
<pre>
  % make
</pre>
<p>
On Solaris, edit the top-level Makefile and change the value of "ARCH" from "linuxegcs" to "solarisCC5".
Then type
<pre>
  % gmake
</pre>
On other Unices, you will have to provide an appropriate "ARCH" section in each of the three Makefiles:
<pre>
  ./Makefile
  hana_decode/Makefile
  hana_scaler/Makefile
</pre>

<b>Building on ifarml1/2/3</b>
<p>
Download the source tarball, unpack, set up ROOT and gcc, and compile:
<pre>
   % lynx -source http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/download/analyzer-1.0.tar.gz > analyzer-1.0.tar.gz
   % tar xzvf analyzer-1.0.tar.gz 
   % cd analyzer-1.0
   % use root/3.03-06-gcc3.0.4
   % use gcc/3.0.4
   % make -j4
   ( ... go drink a coffee ... )

   Quick test of the build:

   % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
   % ./analyzer
</pre>

<b>Recovering from a corrupted build</b>
<p>
If you build fails because something wasn't set up right, restarting the build may fail with
weird error messages. In such a case, try
<pre>
  % find . -name '*.d' -exec rm {} \;
  % make realclean
  % make
</pre>
Only if this fails you are likely to have a real problem with the source code.
<hr>
<h3>Installation</h3>
To run the analyzer in an arbitrary directory, a number of environment variables need to be set up.
Assuming you built the Analyzer in ~/analyzer-1.0, the setup would be as follows:
<pre>
For bash (Linux default):

  % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/analyzer-1.0:$ROOTSYS/lib
  % export DB_DIR=~/analyzer-1.0/DB
  % export PATH=~/analyzer-1.0:$PATH

For tcsh (JLab Computer Center default):

  % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ~/analyzer-1.0:${ROOTSYS}/lib
  % setenv DB_DIR ~/analyzer-1.0/DB
  % set path = ( ~/analyzer-1.0 $path )

</pre>
Instead of adding the build directory to PATH, you could link ~/analyzer-1.0/analyzer to your
working directory. 
<p>
You probably want to put these definitions in your login script: ~/.bash_profile or ~/.login.

<hr>
<h3>Running</h3>
Go to your working directory and type:
<pre>
  % analyzer
</pre>
or, if you did not modify the PATH:
<pre>
  % ./analyzer
</pre>
You should see the startup message:
<pre>

Type ? for help. Commands must be C++ statements.
Enclose multiple statements between { }.

</pre>
Since the Analyzer is built on top of ROOT, you now have access to all ROOT commands
from the Analyzer command prompt.  Running the Analyzer is like running ROOT with
a bunch of extra classes available.  The special Analyzer classes are listed in the
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/USER_Index.html">Analyzer Class Index</a>.
<p>
If you are a new user, you might want to look at the example scripts in the examples/
subdirectory of the distribution.  Documentation of them can be found in the
<a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart Guide</a>.

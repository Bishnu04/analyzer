<h2>Hall A C++ Analyzer version 1.1</h2>

17 November 2003
<p>
After several months of development of testing, the Hall A software team is pleased
to present the next version of the Hall A C++ Analyzer. You should find
this version more powerful and more user-friendly than the previous
release. This version is largely backwards compatible with version 1.0.
<hr>

<h3>What's new</h3>
Compared to release 1.0, the following features have been added:
<ul>
  <li>New physics modules: coincidence kinematics, coincidence time
  <li>Time-of-flight and beta calculation between scintillator planes
  <li>Vector formulas and histograms and other improvements to the output module
  <li>Support for the ET system as a data source (THaOnlRun)
  <li>Runs without prestart events (ET, continuation segments) can now be analyzed
  <li>Prescale factors are extracted and saved
  <li>Many usability improvements to the event loop class THaAnalyzer and run
      object class THaRun (Init()/Print() methods, status flags, event counters, etc.)
  <li>Standardized database interface (available, but not used yet)
  <li>Support for using a custom decoder (other file formats, simulation input)
</ul>

<h3>Removed Limitations</h3>
Known limitations are documented in the <a href="RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.txt">Release
Notes for version 1.0</a>.
The following limitations have been removed:
<ul>
  <li>Scintillator time walk corrections are now calculated and used
      in the ToF, beta, and coincidence time computations.
  <li>Physics modules (or equivalent) are now available for
      <ul>
	<li>Secondary particle kinematics
	<li>Beta & time-of-flight
	<li>Coincidence time
      </ul>
  <li>Beam helicity schemes other than G0 are supported, although
      switching to a different scheme requires recompilation of the
      THaHelicity class with different preprocessor flags.
  <li>Arrays can now be used in formula and histogram definitions.
      An array of histograms now can be defined with a single command.
  <li>Several cut (but not yet output) definition files can be loaded before
      starting the analysis.
  <li>Second and subsequent segments of split data files can now be
      analyzed with proper setup of THaRun objects.
</ul>      

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
Version 1.1 is essentially source-compatible with version 1.0, but
not binary-compatible. Modules developed for version 1.0
should not require any source code changes, but must be recompiled.

<h3>System requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linux with gcc/g++; or Solaris with the Sun Workshop compiler
  <li>ROOT 3.02 or higher
  <li>GNU make
  <li>Decent hardware (at least 300MHz CPU, 128MB RAM).
</ul>
The following platforms have been explicitly tested:
<ul>
  <li>RedHat Linux 9 with default compiler (gcc 3.2.2) and ROOT 3.05/04
  <li>RedHat Linux 7.2 with gcc-3.2.3 and ROOT 3.05/07 (ifarml1/2/3).
  <li>RedHat Linux 6.2 with default compiler (egcs-2.91.66) and ROOT 3.02/00.
  <li>Solaris 8 with Sun Workshop compiler suite 6, C++ 5.3 (ifarms1).
</ul>
Most other recent Linux and Solaris installations should work as well.
Other Unix platforms require (probably fairly simple) changes to the Makefiles.

<h3>Building and installing the program</h3>
Please see <a href="install.html">docs/install.html</a>

<h3>Running the program / How to analyze data</h3>
Please see <a href="quickstart.html">docs/quickstart.html</a> and
the <a href="index.html">main documentation page</a>.

<h3>Example Scripts</h3>
Example scripts can be found in the "examples" and "examples/BPM" subdirectories.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
Further documentation is available in the "docs" subdirectory and
at the <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/">project home page</a>.

<h2>Hall A C++ Analyzer version 1.2</h2>

12 April 2004
<p>
The Hall A software team is pleased
to present the next version of the Hall A C++ Analyzer. You should find
this version more powerful and more user-friendly than the previous
release. Also, it includes fixes to a large number of small bugs that
were discovered during the first production running in Dec 2003-Jan 2004.
<hr>

<h3>What's new</h3>
Compared to Release 1.1, the following features have been added:
<ul>
  <li>Scaler and EPICS (slow control) data can be included in the output ROOT file
  <li>Raw CODA events can be written to a CODA output file subject to cuts
      (event filtering)
  <li>New Begin() and End() methods for THaAnalysisObjects that are called
      at start and end of replay, respectively. Apparatuses call these
      methods for all detectors defined for the apparatus.
  <li>Additional optional test blocks "CoarseTracking" and "Tracking" (=FineTrack)
  <li>Improved coincidence time module THaCoincTime
  <li>Improved low-level DAQ module THaDecData
  <li>Scaler, EPICS and helicity decoding/processing can be enabled/disabled
      explicitly
  <li>The matrix elements section of the VDC database can be segmented into
      different configurations.
  <li>Shared libraries use version numbers
  <li>Analyzer macros can now use STL vector and string classes
  <li>Restructured THaAnalyzer class, greatly simplifying extensions and/or
      modifications of the event loop
  <li>Many small bug fixes and usability improvements throughout the code
</ul>

<h3>Removed Limitations</h3>
Known limitations are documented in the <a href="RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.txt">Release
Notes for version 1.0</a>.
The following limitations have been removed in Release 1.2:
<ul>
  <li>EPICS history should now be recorded correctly. All EPICS variables
      encountered in the CODA file are now decoded and made available.
</ul>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
Version 1.2 is essentially source-compatible with version 1.1, but
not binary-compatible. Modules developed for version 1.1
should not require any source code changes, but must be recompiled.

<h3>System requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linux with gcc/g++; or Solaris with the Sun Workshop compiler
  <li>ROOT 3.02 or higher
  <li>GNU make
  <li>Decent hardware (at least 300MHz CPU, 128MB RAM).
</ul>
The following platforms have been explicitly tested:
<ul>
  <li>RedHat Enterprise Linux 3WS with default compiler (gcc 3.2.3) and ROOT 3.10/02
  <li>RedHat Linux 9 with default compiler (gcc 3.2.2) and ROOT 3.05/04
</ul>
Most other recent Linux and Solaris installations should work as well.
Other Unix platforms require (probably fairly simple) changes to the Makefiles.

<h3>Building and installing the program</h3>
Please see <a href="install.html">docs/install.html</a>

<h3>Running the program / How to analyze data</h3>
Please see <a href="quickstart.html">docs/quickstart.html</a> and
the <a href="index.html">main documentation page</a>.

<h3>Example Scripts</h3>
Example scripts can be found in the "examples" and "examples/BPM" subdirectories.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
Further documentation is available in the "docs" subdirectory and
at the <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/">project home page</a>.

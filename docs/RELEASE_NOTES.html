<h2>Hall A C++ Analyzer version 1.3</h2>

11 June 2004
<p>
The Hall A software team is pleased to present version 1.3 of the
Hall A C++ Analyzer. The main improvement in this version is the
addition of a beam data interface for the physics modules, which
allows physics modules to apply corrections to those data or
to re-compute them. Additionally,
a first version of energy loss correction modules as well as
other useful physics modules are included. 
<hr>

<h3>What's new</h3>
Compared to Release 1.2, the following features have been added:
<ul>
  <li>Energy loss corrections (both for tracks and for the beam)
      have been implemented. This is still somewhat preliminary.
  <li>Physics modules can import and export beam information in a similar
      way as track and vertex information.
  <li>The electron kinematics module now optionally accepts beam
      information (i.e. incident momentum vector) for improved resolution
      with rastered beam.
  <li>Events that belong to more than one event class (physics events
      that are also scaler events, for example) can be properly analyzed.
  <li>All output files are now explicitly closed when terminating the analyzer.
      Previously, filtered files sometimes were not flushed completely.
  <li>New module THaNormAna allows dead-time and charge analysis.
      This is still somewhat preliminary.
  <li>New module THaEpicsEbeam allows extraction of the beam energy from
      an EPICS variable. This is an experimental feature.
  <li>Many small bug fixes throughout the code.
  <li>Support for ROOT version 4.
</ul>

<h3>Removed Limitations</h3>
Known limitations are documented in
the <a href="RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.txt">Release
Notes for version 1.0</a>.
The following limitations have been removed in Release 1.3:
<ul>
  <li>Energy loss corrections are now possible. Handling complex
      target geometries, however, is not well supported yet.
</ul>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
Version 1.3 is essentially source-compatible with version 1.2, but
not binary-compatible. Modules developed for version 1.2
should not require any source code changes, but must be recompiled.

<h3>System requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linux with gcc/g++; or Solaris with the Sun Workshop compiler.
  <li>ROOT 3.02 or higher
  <li>GNU make
  <li>Decent hardware (at least 300MHz CPU, 128MB RAM).
</ul>
The following platforms have been explicitly tested:
<ul>
  <li>RedHat Enterprise Linux 3WS with default compiler (gcc 3.2.3)
      and ROOT 3.10/02 and ROOT 4.00/04.
  <li>RedHat Linux 9 with default compiler (gcc 3.2.2) and ROOT 3.05/04
</ul>
Most other recent Linux and Solaris installations should work as well.
Other Unix platforms require (probably fairly simple) changes to the Makefiles.
The analyzer has been reported to work on IRIX and Mac OS X; those
ports will be included in a future release. We have no plans to
support Windows.

<h3>Building and installing the program</h3>
Please see <a href="install.html">docs/install.html</a>

<h3>Running the program / How to analyze data</h3>
Please see <a href="quickstart.html">docs/quickstart.html</a> and
the <a href="index.html">main documentation page</a>.

<h3>Example Scripts</h3>
Example scripts can be found in the "examples" and "examples/BPM" subdirectories.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
Further documentation is available in the "docs" subdirectory and
at the <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/">project home page</a>.

# This file: scaler.map
# Author: Robert Michaels, Jlab, updated March 2001
# Contains time-dependent text-based mapping of Hall A scaler channels
# 2 kinds of fields :  "date"  and  scaler-map-info.
# date format (without quotes): "date(this must be capital) day month year" 
# scaler-map-info that appears after date pertains to time after, and
# until the next date field (in time).  The order is irrelevant.
# The format of scaler-map-info is as following line:
# short-name  helicity  crate-num  slot-num  start-chan  num-chan  long-name
# where:
#    short-name = string corresponding to data member in THaScaler
#    helicity :  0 = none, -1 = negative, +1 = positive
#    crate :  THaCrateMap convention (7=Right, 8=Left, 9=RCS)
#    slot:  Comes from 17th-20th bits of VME header, is related to 
#           physical slot in VME (usually in order left to right).
#    start-chan, num-chan starting and number of channels in raw data
#    long-name: Long descriptive string used for plots.
# Note about channel indices:  0 = 1st one (C-style)
# Report problems to the author.
